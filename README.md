## A (couple) bit(s) about him

He is a graduate student at [Ohio University](https://www.ohio.edu/). He manages to spend more running [OU Thai Student Association's website](https://tsaou.page/) on its own domain (he should just use Linktree). He thought it was fun to help run a conference and also live debugging production codebase for said conference. He loves to spend months automate task that only takes a few hours.

This is couple bytes in utf-8 than couple bits.

## Fun facts

- His contribution to open source projects so far are documentation fixes :joy:.
