## About him

<a href="https://twitter.com/chipencil" target="_blank"><img align="right" width="100" alt="Kokomi by chipencil" src="https://i.imgur.com/Wva3UCK.jpg" /></a>

He is a Ph.D. student at [Ohio University](https://www.ohio.edu/) studying machine learning for game-playing agent and user interface design for augmented reality devices. He manages to spend more running [OU Thai Student Association's website](https://tsaou.page/) on its own domain (he should just use Linktree). He thought it was fun to help run a conference and also live debugging the production codebase for said conference. He loves to spend months automating a task that only takes a few hours to complete if done manually.

## Fun facts

- His contribution to open source projects so far are documentation fixes :joy:.
